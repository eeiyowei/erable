* Central proble of phylogenomics, infer species tree based on gene trees
	- such a tree = phylogenomic tree

* Here, this problem, but also:
	- infer branch lengths (#substitutions/time)
	- gene-wise evolutionary rates (relative)

* Some problems:
	- heterogeneity in evolution of different genomic regions
	- only partial overlap in taxa between different genomic regions

* Tree main approaches:
	- supertree
	- superalignment
	- medium-level

* ERaBLE:
	- a method for estimation of branch lengths for phylogenomic tree
	  informative for:
	  	; molecular dating (speciation/WGDs)
		; reconciliation
	- also gene-wise evolutionary rates (relative!)
		; detect selective pressures across genes across taxa
	- only computationally very intensive methods available
	- ERaBLE -> seconds
